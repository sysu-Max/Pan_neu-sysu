Comprehensive single-cell analysis unveils heterogeneous neutrophil across cancer

Neutrophils exert multifaceted roles during cancer initiation, growth and metastasis. However, the function and abundance of Neutrophils within TME across multiple cancer types remains elusive. Herein, conducting a comprehensive analysis of neutrophils in TME, inflammation, and COVID-1, we identified characteristics of tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) across cancers. We observed that VEGFA is significantly up-regulated in TANs, showing neutrophil-mediated angiogenesis in TME. Additionally, specific subpopulation of TANs was characterized with PDL1 positive, appearing to promote T cell dysfunction and immune scape, and function well as a predictive marker for cancer immunotherapy. Our study elucidates the pro-tumor characteristics of neutrophils at a pan-cancer level, offering new perspectives for stage-specific cancer therapies.
