Pan-cancer single-cell dissection identifies conserved pro-tumorigenic VEGFA+ and CD274+ neutrophils

Tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) are critical components in cancer progression, yet the pan-cancer, conserved programs that shape tumor evolution remain incompletely defined. We integrated single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from 337,681 neutrophils from 339 donors across nine cancer types, inflammatory conditions, and healthy tissues. We identified two conserved neutrophil subsets, VEGFA+ and CD274+, that are consistently present across multiple cancer types and exhibit distinct spatial niches: VEGFA+ neutrophils colocalized with endothelial cells, whereas CD274+ neutrophils proximal to exhausted T cells. Mechanistically, VEGFA+ neutrophils potentiate angiogenesis through VEGFA-VEGFAR interactions with endothelial cells, while CD274+ neutrophils promote CD8+ T cell dysfunction via PD-L1-PD-1 axis. Clinically, a high abundance of VEGFA+ neutrophils correlates with poor survival across multiple cancers, whereas greater baseline levels of CD274+ neutrophils predict improved immunotherapeutic responses. Both neutrophil subsets exhibited terminal differentiation states governed by distinct transcription factor (TF) regulatory networks. Collectively, these findings delineate conserved, pro-tumorigenic neutrophil programs across diverse cancer types, nominating actionable targets and predictive biomarkers for cancer therapy.
